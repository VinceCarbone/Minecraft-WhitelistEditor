Easily add multiple users to your Java server's whitelist in one go

```.\Minecraft-WhitelistEditor.ps1 -users user1,user2,user3 -filepath "\\path\to\minecraft\root\folder"```

This will automatically look up the usernames and their associated UUIDs and add them to either a new or existing whitelist.json file in the specified directory.

This is also compatible with adding Bedrock players to the whitelist.
